This was my project for practicing **React**.

## About

While learning **React**, I looked for a project idea to practice my skills. \
A friend of mine suggested that I'll make a small flashcard application that teaches the most popular words from a few different languages, and I loved this idea. \
A few days later I started to work on the design, and quickly this project turned into something bigger.

## My Ideas

- Instead of having just Flashcards, I thought it would be nice to add a Quiz feature.
- **Quiz:**
  - The user needs to write the correct translation.
  - Can Skip (counts as wrong)
  - Streak feature, as the user answer correctly, the streak starts to build until the use gets a wrong answer.
- **Flashcards**:
  - The user needs to guess the word before flipping the card, and press on the difficulty of the word `(Hard, Okay, Easy)`.
- **Sessions (common features between Quiz and Flashcards):**
  - Each session got 10 words (randomly)
  - Word familarity will rank by level, from 1 to 5
  - User can listen to the word's audio
  - At the end of each session, show score as: How many correct/wrong/skipped (or hard/okay/easy)
  - Progress Bar
- User Authentication
