## About

While learning **React**, I looked for a project idea to practice my skills. \
A friend of mine suggested that I'll make a small flashcard application that teaches the most popular words from a few different languages, and I loved this idea. \
After a few days, I started to work on the design, and quickly this project turned into something bigger.

## My Ideas

- Instead of having just Flashcards, I thought it would be nice to add a Quiz feature.
- **Quiz:**
  - The user needs to write the correct translation.
  - Can Skip (counts as wrong)
  - Streak feature (as the user answers correctly, the streak starts to build until the user gets a wrong answer).
- **Flashcards**:
  - The user needs to guess the meaning of the word before flipping the card.
- **Sessions (features that are both in Quiz and Flashcards):**
  - Each session got ten words (randomly)
  - Word familiarity will rank by level, from 1 to 5
  - User can listen to the word's audio
  - At the end of each session, show score as: How many correct/wrong/skipped (or hard/okay/easy)
  - Progress Bar
- User Authentication
