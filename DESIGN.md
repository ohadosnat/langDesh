# Design Process

I used **Figma** to design this project (as always).

## **Sessions**

I started to design the sessions first (flashcard/quiz) since they are the main features.

<details>
<summary>Drafts</summary>
These drafts only feature the flashcard session type & the end report. <br/>

<summary>Final Design</summary>
Small Notes: <br/>

- I thought to add a <code>dark mode</code> feature, but I decided not to (for now ðŸ˜Ž).
- I tried to make the design more consistent. <br/>
- The colors are more pleasant.
- You can see that I've tried a few audio icons, I ended up with the <code>speaker</code> icon.

## **Home & Course**

After that, I worked on the Home & Course pages.

<details>
<summary>Home</summary>

- The home page is an overview for the user (overall progress in each language/course).
- From here, the user can choose what to do (go to profile, start a quiz/flashcard session, or view the course's words).
- I wanted to make a single page that the user can see everything right away and start learning.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Course</summary>

- Users can go into each course and: see its words, search words, and view the familiarity level of each word.
- This design helps users to see their progress and search for specific a word.

<details>
<summary>Add New Language</summary>

- I had a two ideas for this feature
  - The first was to create a button below the last user language (on the home page) that says "Add New Language."
  - The second was to add a button on the menu.
- I went with the second one since it was cleaner.
- The page design was simple since there are only four languages (currently), I designed it like this. But in terms of scaling, It can work.

<details>
<summary>Sign In & Sign Up</summary>

- The final design is mostly the same, except for the image & the continue with Google button.
- I wanted to make these pages as simple as possible.
